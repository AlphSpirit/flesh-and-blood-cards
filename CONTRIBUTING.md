# Contributing

Welcome!

If you're reading this, hopefully you're interested in helping out with the maintenance of this data set by adding missing info or fixing mistakes I've made while entering the data. If you are interested, please continue reading for instructions on how to help. Otherwise, I hope this data set has been helpful to you, and even if you have no interest in contributing, if you notice any mistakes or have suggestions, please [create an issue](https://github.com/the-fab-cube/flesh-and-blood-cards/issues/new) so I or someone else can fix it!

## Getting Started
1. Find an Issue you'd like to work on.
    a. You can find a list of open issues [here](https://github.com/the-fab-cube/flesh-and-blood-cards/issues) and a summary of data entry milestones [here](https://github.com/flesh-cube/flesh-and-blood-cards/milestones).
2. Check to make sure no one is assigned to the Issue.
3. If no one is working on it, please leave a comment mentioning you would like to work on it and I will assign you to the Issue.
4. When you are done with your work, create a PR to this repo's develop branch and tag the issue you were working on. I'll review it and if it's good to go, approve it!


## Entering CSV Data
I have LibreOffice files in the repo for easy editing. It is okay if you do not use them, I will update them with any changes other people make without using LibreOffice, but they are there for convenience. To use them, just open the .ods file and edit, and then when done, export the file as a .csv to the appropriate langue's folder in the csvs folder with Save As, making sure to choose Tabs as the delimiter and " as the string indicator.

NOTE: You can find the CSV schema data [here](/documentation/csv-schemas.md).

## Data Requirements
- All image links must be from LSS' site.
- Functional text must be the latest oracle text.

Thanks again for helping out!
