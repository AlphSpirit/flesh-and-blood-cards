Welcome!

If you're reading this, hopefully you're interested in helping out with the maintenance of this data set by adding missing info or fixing mistakes
I've made while entering the data. If you are interested, please continue reading for instructions on how to help. Otherwise, I hope this data set
has been helpful to you, and even if you have no interest in contributing, if you notice any mistakes or have suggestions, please create an Issue
so I or someone else can fix it!

### Getting Started
1. Find an Issue you'd like to work on.
2. Check to make sure no one is assigned to the Issue.
3. If no one is working on it, please leave a comment mentioning you would like to work on it and I will assign you to the Issue.
4. When you are done with your work, create a PR to this repo's develop branch and tag the issue you were working on. I'll review it and if it's good to go, approve it!

### Data Requirements
- All image links must be from LSS' site.
- Functional text must be the latest oracle text.

Thanks again for helping out!
