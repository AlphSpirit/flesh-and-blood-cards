Welcome!

If you're reading this, hopefully you're interested in helping out with the maintenance of this data set by adding missing info or fixing mistakes
I've made while entering the data. If you are interested, please continue reading for instructions on how to help. Otherwise, I hope this data set
has been helpful to you, and even if you have no interest in contributing, if you notice any mistakes or have suggestions, please create an Issue
so I or someone else can fix it!

### Getting Started
1. Find an Issue you'd like to work on.
2. Check the comments to make sure no one has mentioned they are working on it.
3. If no one is working on it, please leave a comment mentioning you are working on it so others don't duplicate your work.
5. When you are done with your work, create a PR to this repo's develop branch and tag the issue you were working on. I'll review it and if it's good to go, approve it!

Thanks again for helping out!
